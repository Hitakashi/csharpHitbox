# csharpHitbox

This is a C# WebSocket Chat Bot for www.hitbox.tv. It implements the connection and partial-handling of **incoming** messages. The logic side of it should be coded by you. I have included templates for all outgoing messages in the MessageHandler.

This was originally coded in Java by [BitOBytes](www.twitter.com/bitobytes) and converted to C# by myself.
